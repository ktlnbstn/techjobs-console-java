# techjobs-console-java
Assignment for the Java skill track in LaunchCode 101, Seattle 2017


> The TechJobs Console is a platform of searchable job opportunities. I am using Java and Spring. First I create a 
prototype, usable via the command line. Then I build it into a stronger application by using Objects, Models, 
inheritance, and ORMS.
